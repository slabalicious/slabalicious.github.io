              <strong>Criteria:</strong> In “City Limits,” Colson Whitehead explores how each New Yorker has his or her own private New York built brick by brick from experiences of interacting in the city.  He concludes that we must cherish the places of our private New York because they are like landmarks to our identities as we grow and change with the city; this city has helped create each one of us, and the city and our “selves” are inextricably intertwined.  So here we are - each of us will write our own homage to a part of our own New York, an aspect of the city that we will always carry with us.  The purpose of this project is to develop a central idea about YOUR New York City: either a specific observation about life in the city, or a specific  observation about New Yorkers or a subset of New Yorkers, or an homage to a particular community within the city, a window or sliding glass door for others to better appreciate this city.

              <strong>Criteria:</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
