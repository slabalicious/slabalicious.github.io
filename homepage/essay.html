            There’s No Place Like Home
            A guy on my block died. Pick your jaw off the floor; it's a monthly occurrence for me. This time, it was different, though; This time, the guy was the deli man's kid. Everybody with a sense of community knows you never hurt the deli worker's family. Their shop is the hub of every hood; Everyone respects them, and if somebody harms them or their family, the whole neighborhood caves in like quicksand. That's how gentrification comes along. I'd know; I've seen it happen.
            Delis are the heart of New York, and — I stand by this— nobody can ever be a true New Yorker until they have a favorite deli. What I mean when I say "favorite deli" is somewhere
            They have a nickname,
            They know a worker's name, or
             They can invoke the unofficial New Yorker honor system, which, at a deli, has more weight than a legal ID. Being able to say, "I'll pay this back later," and it being a valid form of currency is a superpower.
            Checking off even one out of three of these rules is proof of the deli choosing them, and when a deli dubs somebody worthy, they accept. My dude is Sammi; he always calls me gorgeous, and if I'm ever less than 2 dollars short, he'll spot me with no expectations. I think I'd take a bullet for him.
            I saw somebody shot dead in front of my building at the ripe age of 8. My block was always busiest when it was dark, and we were a daily stop for the cops, the ambulance, the fire department, or occasionally all 3. One night, I crept up to the window to make my nightly guess of which first responder would make a special appearance when I was met by the strange silhouette of a bloodstained, spread-out face-down stranger. He had been there long enough for spots of red to seep out his wounds into the sidewalk until eventually smudged away by the soles of my neighbors in the months to come. We ignored the screaming people on the train, the sleeping people on the streets, the smelly people in the stores, and the homeless who were audacious enough to ask a kid for money. How was this any different? That's the day I knew I was a real New Yorker. Ignoring somebody in pain because it might compromise my safety or peace of mind is the most New York thing I've ever done. "See something and say nothing" is the actual motto, and every real New Yorker lives by it.
            There's a rumor about how New Yorkers are judgy, people-watching hustling freakazoids, but they've got it twisted. We don't care about what anybody's doing. New Yorkers never have time for things. There's always a train to catch, a job to do, a kid to pick up, or an argument to pick. We can barely lag on the sidewalk without being in unbearable pain, and some people think we'll take the time out of our day to do what? Judge? Absolutely, but we'll do it at 2x speed, in silence, and through the art of shooting side eyes to our unfamiliar fellow New Yorkers.
            To be blunt, New Yorkers are a contradiction. We have a language where we talk about strangers to other strangers after preaching, trusting no one. We won't give a dollar to that crackhead on 14th Street, but we see him more often than the person we're judging him with. The shared experience of the bizarreness that is a day in New York City builds a community, but it's shallow. Hollow and empty. I won't remember that person a day from now, but there are certain parts of my New York that I'll never forget.
            My deli is the messiest, greasiest four walls of pet food and expired snacks I've ever seen. It's the nasty neighborhood living room that sees everybody at their worst, best, or anywhere in between. A constant mix of people fitted to the nines, women with bonnets sliding off their heads, and raw gums that would typically hide under dentures; "It's just a run to the deli," they think, and they’re a hundred and ten percent correct. We'll never judge others here because this is the real New York community, past all the superficial stuff we're so infamous for. Here, we're raw, throwing privacy to the wind and whatever ancient snacks we crave onto the deli counter. That is what I call a New York moment.
            The last time I stumbled onto a New York moment was with my dad three months ago at a block party. The speakers blasted reggaeton, and aunties dished out burgers fresh off the grill as people from different streets eagerly lined up. I felt my issues melt away as we strolled past the game truck and four bouncy castles and melted into the crowd of dancing neighbors and generations of loyal Brooklynites whose familiar faces shot me a mix of smiles. As my dad greeted everybody and I finished scarfing down my burger, the DJ paused the music and announced for everybody to grab one of the decorative balloons and write the names of the deceased we missed. We'd let the balloons go to celebrate their life, honor their death, and slow down, even for just a second, to acknowledge they were truly gone.
            On my balloon, I honored my late counselor, Dan, my Grandma, and my Grandpa as we sent their names into the sky in unison with a booming countdown. The cheers chilled to an eerie silence as everybody watched the cluster of balloons melt into the atmosphere. Neighbors cried in the arms of strangers, their tears streaking the sidewalk drawings of the kids who currently wondered why their parents' faces were twisted with emotions they didn't quite understand. The sky lit up as the sun set as if our loved ones were screaming, "We see you, and we're okay, " through hues of pink and orange. Soon after, the bouncy houses deflated, and the balloons morphed into a distant, colorful speck. People started to retreat like soldiers, but they didn't go to their respective homes. They didn't go back to work. They took their grief, chatter, and love, took a break from the hustle, and headed to the deli.
